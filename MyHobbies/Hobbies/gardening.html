    <h2>Some gardening tips: </h2>
    <p>New to gardening? Browse our list of hints and tips on getting started,
         sowing, planting and creating wildlife habitats.
        Gardening is fun and rewarding. What could be nicer than eating food 
        you have grown yourself or eating an evening meal on the patio surrounded 
        by the fragrance of scented plants you have grown? It can be hard to know
         when and how to start a garden, but we’re here to guide you through the process.</p>

            <h3>Get to know your garden</h3>
            <p>Before you start, it’s a good idea to get to know your garden.
                 Check the aspect – is it south-facing or north-facing? Knowing where
                  the sun hits the ground will help you decide what to grow where.
                   It’s also worth knowing what soil type you have. Take a look at what’s
                    growing – camellias, magnolias and pieris will tell you the soil is 
                    acidic, while absence of these suggests a more alkaline soil. Doing 
                    a soil test will further help you know your soil, and therefore what
                     plants you can grow.</p>

            <h3>Plan your garden</h3>
            <p>Sitting down and planning your garden is a great starting point. 
                This way you can work out what to grow where, rather than getting carried
                 away at the garden centre and ending up with a jumble of plants that don’t
                  look good together and might not suit your growing conditions. Planning
                   will also enable you to use colour and structure wisely, which will help
                    you create a garden that looks great throughout the year.</p>

            <h3>Learn how to plant</h3>
            <p>Planting your plants properly will ensure they grow well and live for a long
                 time. Make sure you take time to weed and prepare the soil before planting,
                  and add mulch or fertiliser where necessary. If you’re unsure how to plant 
                  something, look online for instructions rather than just hoping for the
                   best. Trees planted too deeply will never thrive, and root-balls that sit
                    proud of the soil surface will dry out quickly, leading to the eventual 
                    death of the plant.</p>

            <h3>Feed and water plants regularly</h3>
            <p>Knowing when and how to water plants is the difference between them living 
                and dying. As a general rule, water the root ball rather than the leaves, 
                as it’s the roots that absorb the water. Soaking the rootball every week is
                 better than watering a little bit every day. Feeding is also important – 
                 generally you should be looking at feeding every fortnight during growing 
                 season (that’s spring and summer), although you will need to feed more if
                  growing in containers.</p>
